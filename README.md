# RenW-Powering a sustainable future, one blockchain at a time



## Description

RenW is a form of financial instrument that enables individuals or groups to invest in renewable energy projects, such as wind or solar farms. It operates on an Ethereum-based platform, which provides security and decentralization. This platform has the added advantage of being open to anyone, ranging from private entities developing large-scale energy farms to personal energy farms where friends and family can invest.

For instance, suppose you are establishing a small solar farm worth INR 30,000. To raise capital, you can create five shares valued at INR 5,000 each and list them on the blockchain. Prospective investors can purchase these shares, which fluctuate in value based on factors like time of day, overall market outlook, and buy-sell ratios. This makes renewable energy more accessible to the masses, thereby accelerating its adoption. It also offers people an attractive investment opportunity to invest their capital.
